*THE EEG DATA HAS BEEN CAPTURED @BCI-HCI LAB, COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, IIT KHARAGPUR, INDIA.

#IMPORTANT NOTE #1

*TEMPLATE FOLLOWED FOR THE EXPERIMENT FOR SUBJECTS:-

The subjects performed imagined left and right hand movements, and the EEG signals were recorded on all 14 channels using the Emotiv EPOC+ device and OpenViBE. The subjects were provided with stimulus on GUI, designed using the OpenViBE tool. They were provided with two stimulus, a cross figure that marked the beginning of the trial followed by a left or a right arrow on which the task was performed, recording EEG signals from imagery for approximately 4 seconds.

The Data was acquired from 15 subjects. For each subject we collected data over four session. Each session lasted about 20 to 30 minutes, including the time for experimental setup and data recording. The sessions were held on different days. Each session, had 25 trials of left and another 25 trials of right hand movements to be kinesthetically imagined by the subjects. The subjects were shown left and right arrows in random order on the screen and subjects have to think about closing and opening the corresponding fist.


*DEVICE USED:-

	EMOTIVE 	- Epoc+
	SENSOR COUNT 	- 14+2 references
	SENSOR 		- AF3, AF4, F3, F4, FC5, FC6, F7, F8, T7, T8, P7, P8, O1, O2
	SAMPLE RATE	- 128 Hz

*NOTE:-

	1. THE DATA IS CAPTURED USING EMOTIV EPOC+ DEVICE and OPENVIBE.
	
	2. THE DATA IS TAGGED/MARKED USING LUASCRIPT.
	
	3. ELECTRODE LOCATION DATA (.CED) FILE HAS BEEN ATTACHED FOR CONVENIENCE.
	
	4. DATA IS RAW, i.e, THE ARTIFACTS HAVE NOT BEEN REMOVED.
	
	5. DATA IS ['37'X'M'] MATRIX. CHANNEL DATA STARTS FROM CHANNEL#3 - CHANNEL#16 (TOTAL 14 CHANNEL). HERE 'M' IS THE SIZE/TOTAL NUMBER OF SAMPLES.
